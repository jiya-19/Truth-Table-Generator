🧠 Project Title:
Truth Table Generator – Web and Mobile Application

📄 Project Description:
The Truth Table Generator is a cross-platform web and mobile application designed to simplify the analysis and understanding of logical expressions. This tool allows users to input propositional logic formulas and instantly generates their corresponding truth tables, aiding in learning, teaching, and computational logic verification.

The application supports standard Boolean operators such as:

&& (AND)

|| (OR)

! (NOT)

It parses expressions involving variables A-Z and constructs a comprehensive truth table covering all possible input combinations. The tool is designed to help students, educators, and developers verify logical equivalences and perform logic-related computations with ease.

🌐 Key Features:
Clean and intuitive user interface

Two-page structure for simplicity: input & result

Supports logical operators (AND, OR, NOT)

Dynamically parses input and evaluates all combinations
